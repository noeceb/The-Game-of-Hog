In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.

In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.

To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:

Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1.

Example 1: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They score 1 point for the turn.
Example 2: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.
Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores 2 * tens - ones, or 1, whichever is higher; where tens, ones are the digits of the opponent's score

Example 1: The opponent has 46 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. 2 * 4 - 6 = 2; which is greater than 1, so the current player gains 2 points.
Example 2: The opponent has 73 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. 2 * 7 - 3 = 11; which is greater than 1, so the current player gains 11 points.
Example 3: The opponent has 27 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. 2 * 2 - 7 = -3; which is less than or equal to 1, so the current player gains 1 point.
Example 4: The opponent has 7 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. 2 * 0 - 7 = -7; which is less than or equal to 1, so the current player gains 1 point.
Swine Swap. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score, if the absolute difference between the last two digits of the current score and the last two digits of the opponent's score are the same, the scores are swapped

Hint: recall the built-in function abs which calculates the absolute value of a number

Example 1: The current player has a total score of 41 and the opponent has 83. The current player rolls two dice that total 8. The player's new score is 49, and the opponent's score is 83. The absolute difference between the digits of the current score is |4 - 9| = |-5| = 5; the absolute difference between the digits of the opponent's score is |8 - 3| = |5| = 5. The scores are swapped. The current player now has 83 points and the opponent 49.
Example 2 The current player has a total score of 41 and the opponent has 5. The current player rolls three dice that total 8. The player's new score is 49, and the opponent's score is 5. The absolute difference between the digits of the current score is |4 - 9| = |-5| = 5; the absolute difference between the digits of the opponent's score is |0 - 5| = |-5| = 5. The scores are swapped. The current player now has 5 points and the opponent 49.
Example 3 The current player has a total score of 35 and the opponent has 5. The current player rolls three dice that total 8. The player's new score is 43, and the opponent's score is 5. The absolute difference between the digits of the current score is |4 - 3| = |1| = 1; the absolute difference between the digits of the opponent's score is |0 - 5| = |5| = 5. The scores are not swapped. The current player now has 43 points and the opponent still has 5.
Example 4 The current player has a total score of 0 and the opponent has 0. The current player rolls three dice that total 11. The player's new score is 11, and the opponent's score is 0. The absolute difference between the digits of the current score is |1 - 1| = |0| = 0; the absolute difference between the digits of the opponent's score is |0 - 0| = |0| = 0. The scores are swapped. The current player now has 0 points and the opponent 11
